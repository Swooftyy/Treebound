# Treebound

This is a Minecraft: Java Edition plugin that is inspired by Dream's Hunter vs Assassin, the goal in this minigame is to finish the game while there are 1-255 people chasing you, the catch is that you need to always be standing on a leaf block, you will be supplied a permanent leaf source  in your 9th slot. If a chaser is found not on a leaf they will be taken back to world spawn.
